# Analysis by Synthesis

This is a complete reimplementation of our [Analysis by Synthesis](https://github.com/bethgelab/AnalysisBySynthesis) model.
The experiments in the paper were done with the original implementation. To the best of my knowledge, both are equivalent
and I tried to carefully reproduce all results but I cannot make any guarantees.

## Results from the paper
